  <Summary><strong> Day 8 : Circuit Design and Spice Simulation</strong></summary>

## SPICE Simulation
SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is a powerful simulation tool developed at UC Berkeley in the early 1970â€™s, used in electronics design to model and analyze the behavior of electronic circuits before they are physically built.

The input file is often called a ***SPICE deck*** and each line is called a ***card*** because it was once provided to a mainframe as a deck of punch cards.

A circuit simulator is provided with an input file that contains:

- A netlist consisting of components and nodes detailing the circuit connectivity.
- The netlist can be entered by hand or extracted from a circuit schematic or layout in a CAD program.
- Component behaviour by means of device models and model parameters.
- The Initial state of the circuit -- initial conditions
- Inputs to the circuit, called stimulus
- Simulation options & analysis commands that explain the type of simulation to be run.
