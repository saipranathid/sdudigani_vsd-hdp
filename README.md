# VSD Hardware Design Program

Welcome to my learning journey through the **VSD Hardware Design Program (VSD-HDP)**!  
This repository documents my hands-on progress, key takeaways, and daily explorations in digital hardware design.

## üìò Day-wise Progress

- [Day 0: Tools Installation & Environment Setup](Day0/README.md)
- [Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis](Day1/README.md)
- [Day 2: Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles](Day2/README.md)
- [Day 3: Combinational and Sequential optmizations](Day3/README.md)
- [Day 4: GLS, Blocking vs Non-Blocking and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch](Day4/README.md)



## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- Verilog HDL
- Yosys (Open-Source Synthesis Tool)
- GTKWave
- OpenLANE (Digital ASIC Design Flow)
- Sky130 PDK
